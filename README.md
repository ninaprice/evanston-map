<h4> Clarke's </h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 7:00 a.m. to 12 a.m. </h6>
<p class="byline"> by Joanne Lee </p>

<p> Bustling with customers, Clarke's Diner is a great place to grab brunch. The menu has a large selection of breakfast foods. However, because of the large number of people in the diner, there is little space to move around. Another problem is how long the food takes to come out. This is all based on one experience, but I spent a majority of the time waiting for the food rather than actually eating. Other customers were asking the waitress when the food would come out. But when my western omelet did reach the table, it had quality. The portion sizes were generous, and the food was delicious. The food somewhat compensated for the service. So while the service and the experience at the diner were not the best, the food made the visit worthwhile.
</p>
<p> The store is located halfway down the block of Clark Street between Sherman and Orrington avenues.

</div><h4> Coffee Lab </h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.; closed Sundays.</h6>
<p class="byline"> by Matt Stockmal </p>

<p class="review">  I wrote my economy feature on local coffee shops in Evanston, so I have been to five coffee shops around Evanston, and Coffee Lab surpasses the rest by far. Each cup is ground by hand to order and the baristas can control everything from the acidity to the amount of caffeine in each cup. I had the best white chocolate mocha I have ever had. The environment is inviting and the Wi-Fi is fast, so writing your trend story will be just a little bit more bearable in Coffee Lab. But beware, Coffee Lab is on Noyes Street, which is pretty far north of campus, about a 20-minute walk.
</p>
<p class="location">  The shop is on the corner of Noyes Street and Maple Avenue.

<h4> Einstein Bros Bagels </h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.</h6>
<p class="byline"> by Pablo Muñoz </p>

<p> A relatively inexpensive morning alternative to 1835 Hinman, Einstein Bros. offers coffee, bagels, sandwiches and other snacks within a 10-minute walk of East Fairchild. Occasionally crowded in the mornings, this is a great place for a slow-paced breakfast with friends. Iced coffee and a bagel with lox or one toasted and buttered are among the top choices. A personal favorite is the cheddar jalapeño bagel, toasted and buttered. The fruit salads and lemonades are good choices, too. 
   </p>
<p>The store is located at the corner of Clark Steet and Sherman Avenue.

<h4> Le Peep </h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. daily.</h6>
<p class="byline"> by Michael Bass </p>

<p> Le Peep is the pantheon of good brunch food in Evanston. The menu is all-encompassing — delicious coffee, smoothies, omelets, sandwiches and burgers highlight the menu. My favorite is the California turkey sandwich with extra crispy sweet potato fries. Emphasis on the extra crispy. Turkey, bacon and melted mozzarella with avocado and mayonnaise on grilled bread. Heavenly. The omelets and eggs are great and the pancakes are well-known. The service is quick and makes up for the incredibly long lines on Sundays. It is well-priced, given the quality of food. Word of advice: don’t try it on the Fourth of the July. The food is amazing, but it takes a significant amount of endurance to wait in a 30-minute line. </p>
<p> The store is located at the corner of Church Street and Benson Avenue.

<h4> Peet's Coffee & Tea </h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.</h6>
<p class="byline"> by Pablo Muñoz </p>

<p> Peet’s Coffee and Tea, despite being a chain, does not give one the impression of being a corporate managed store like its larger rival. The Peet’s in Evanston feels more like a local coffee shop, despite prices that are higher than those at the nearby Starbucks. The store offers the usual assortment of coffee and espresso-based beverages, along with a selection of summery, iced beverages for a dose of morning sugar. 
  </p>
<p> The store is located halfway down the block of Chicago Avenue between Church and Davis streets.

<h4> Unicorn Cafe</h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 6:30 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. daily. 
</h6>
<p class="byline"> by Pablo Muñoz </p>
<p> The Unicorn Cafe is an Evanston staple. The coffee shop retains a small-town feel and reasonable prices, although those with only a credit card are better off crossing the street to Starbucks. The store does not have a large selection of pastries or traditional coffee accompaniments, but the beverage selection is comprised of locally sourced coffees and teas.  </p>
<p> The cafe is located halfway down the block of Sherman Avenue between Clark and Church streets.

<h4> Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza </h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily.</h6>
<p class="byline"> by Michael Bass </p>
<p> Pressed for time? Let’s just go to Blaze. Can’t decide where to eat? Let’s just go to Blaze. I cannot tell you how many times I have had this conversation with my friends. Why? The pizza is delicious and customizable, the crust is thin (deep-dish seekers will be sorely disappointed), the service is efficient and the meal is reasonably priced. You can build your own pizza or order one of the recommended combinations, such as the “Meat Lover,” the “Red Vine” or the “White Top.” 
 </p>
<p>The store can be found along Sherman Avenue between Clark and Church streets.

<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 11:00 a.m. to 3 a.m.; closed Mondays and Tuesdays. </h6>
<p class= "byline"> by Molly Glick </p>


<p> The local chain is a cherub favorite, with over ten different varieties of grilled cheese. Diners can choose from appetizers like tater tots and fried mac n’ cheese bites, or a gourmet grilled cheese loaded with additional ingredients. Make sure to arrive with an empty stomach. 
 </p>
<p> The store can be found on Davis Street between Orrington and Chicago avenues.

  <h4> Giordano's </h4>
<h5> Price range: $$ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily. </h6>
<p class="byline"> by Kristine Liao </p>

<p> Since I had no prior knowledge of what a Chicago style pizza was, I was quite overwhelmed when the waiter set down a 2-inch-thick pizza pie at the table. The enormous amount of cheese filled my mouth with a richness that was complemented with bursts of flavor from pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers and onions. Giordano’s deep-dish pizza was well worth the 45-minute wait.   </p>
<p> The store is located on the corner of Chicago Avenue and Davis Street.

</div><h4> LYFE Kitchen </h4>
<h5> Price range: $$ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.</h6>
<p class="byline"> by Megan Pisarczyk </p>

<p> LYFE Kitchen is perfect if you’re looking for a fresh, healthy meal that tastes great. It offers indoor and outdoor seating and ordering at a counter means there is not a long wait. The outdoor space is perfect for sunny Evanston days, and large windows make the indoor dining room feel bright and spacious. I would highly recommend the grilled chicken and avocado sandwich, but the kale and carrot salad on the side really made the meal for me. Don’t worry, if you’re like most other cherubs and hate kale, you can choose another side. </p>
<p> The store is located halfway down the block of Davis Street between Orrington and Chicago avenues.

<h4> Mustard's Last Stand </h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 10:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. </h6>
<p class="byline"> by Pablo Muñoz </p>

<p>Although only convenient as a lunch on the way to the Evanston Fourth of July parade, Mustard’s is a highly rated traditional hot dog stand, serving hot dogs, chili dogs and hamburgers. About a 40-minute walk from campus, Mustard’s is an Evanston staple directly across the street from Northwestern’s football stadium, Ryan Field. For the adventurous and spirited, Mustard’s might be a worthwhile lunchtime journey.  </p>
<p> The store is located halfway down the block of Central Street between Eastwood and Ashland avenues.

<h4> Panera Bread </h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.</h6>
<p class="byline"> by Pablo Muñoz </p>
<p> Panera is a fail-safe choice for quick, healthy fare at any time of day. Whether a bagel and coffee for breakfast, panini for lunch or a pasta dish for dinner, Panera offers a variety of inexpensive options. An assortment from Thai- inspired salads to lemon orzo soup means that a different meal combination can be had multiple times a day, each day of the week. The “you pick two” option proved popular with cherubs at the local branch of the national chain. </p>
<p> The store is located on the corner of Sherman Avenue and Church Street.

<p> Edzo’s is a nearby burger restaurant that has both standard hamburgers and gourmet creations. The truffle fries are exceptional, loaded with parmesan cheese and truffle salt. As for burgers, go for the meat options — the portobello and veggie burgers are somewhat lackluster. There are lots of milkshake flavors that some cherubs combine together in order to create unique shakes. While pricey, the menu offers flexibility and creativity, and the fast service allows quick turnarounds back to campus.  </p>
<p> The store is found on the crossover of Orrington and Sherman avenues.

<p> Koco Table is one of the places in downtown Evanston where one can truly satisfy his or her Asian cravings. A favorite among many is the bulgogi platter, or better known as Korean BBQ, which falls more on the sweet side than the sour. Yet behind these alluring pictures is a price some cherubs are reluctant to spend with a tight budget.  </p>

<p>Lou Malnati’s is best known for its deep-dish pizza, specifically “The Malnati Chicago Classic.” What makes the pizzas stand out is their savory butter crust and mouthwatering Wisconsin-sourced cheese. The pastas that are certainly above mediocre. But of course, good things come to those who wait, and for a Lou Malnati’s pizza, that would be about 30 minutes.</p>
<p> The store is located on the corner of Sherman Avenue and University Place.

<h4> Olive Mediterranean Grill </h4>

<p> If you’re looking for fresh, healthy and fast Mediterranean food, Olive Mediterranean Grill is the way to go. Olive offers a simple, clear menu with quick service that is especially helpful for middle-eastern cuisine first-timers. If you want to get a taste of a little bit of everything, I recommend the “OMG Plate” for $8. You get three sides (a choice of spreads, salad and rice) and your choice of a protein.</p>
<p> The store is located halfway down the block of Sherman Avenue between Church and Clark streets.

<p> I had been craving Japanese food for weeks, so when I finally got the chance to eat at Sashimi Sashimi, I felt complete. The udon noodle soup warmed me up on a chilly Evanston day and the California rolls did not disappoint. It’s hard to restrain oneself from gobbling everything down and getting a stomachache. Sashimi Sashimi is a convenient option that satisfies the stomach with quality food and portion sizes that do not fall short of its price.</p>

<p> Andy’s is by far the most popular dessert destination in Evanston for cherubs, with lines out the door Friday nights. Despite the masses, the service is quick and efficient, and the thick custard holds up well on warm Midwestern nights. Its signature thick concretes and various mix-in choices offer an alternative to frozen yogurt and traditional ice cream.</p>

<h4> Cold Stone Creamery</h4>

<p> When you’re craving rich and smooth ice cream as a treat after a long lecture, Cold Stone Creamery, located on Sherman Avenue, is the perfect ice cream parlor to satisfy your sweet tooth—as long as you’re willing to pay for the quality you receive. A diversity of flavors (including three different variations on vanilla) and special combinations make it nearly impossible to walk in and not find something you would enjoy. However, Cold Stone’s prices feel a bit steep to a Cherub living off limited funds that are supposed to last the entire month. If you care more about the happiness of your taste buds than you do your wallet, then, in the words of Tom Haverford (played by Aziz Ansari on Parks and Recreation), “Treat yo’ self.” </p>
<p> The store is located between Sherman and Orrington avenues.

<h4> Forever Yogurt </h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 12 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. daily.</h6>
<p class="byline"> by Pablo Muñoz </p>

<p> Forever Yogurt is easily missed, thanks to its narrow street frontage on Sherman Avenue. The space is narrow and congested, worsened by the poor layout of the store, which features topping dispensers mounted on a wall across from the yogurt dispensers. Customer traffic jams are common, and the basic selection of flavors is similar to that of the nearby Tutti Frutti. “Forever Yogurt isn’t the quintessential regional frozen yogurt chain, but if you have a hankering, it’ll suffice,” Liam Kirchner said.  <p>
<p> The store is located halfway down the block of Sherman Avenue between Clark and Church streets.

<h4> Kung Fu Tea </h4>
<h5> Price range: $ </h5>

<p> Kung Fu Tea’s menu can seem overwhelming with its large selection and multilingual menu, but it’s well worth the initial confusion. It’s a shorter walk than Joy Yee's Noodle Kitchen and it has a more diverse list of teas and beverages. Think of bubble tea as a smoothie-like beverage with “bubbles,” or tapioca at the bottom. It also offers options for both hot and iced tea. My favorite is the Mango Kung-Fu Slush with bubbles and mango jelly. </p>
<p> The store is located halfway down Clark Street between Sherman and Orrington avenues.

<h4> Patisserie Coralie </h4>
<h5> Price range: $$ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. daily. </h6>
<p class="byline"> by Abigail Felix </p>

<p> This hidden gem in downtown Evanston offers a variety of delicacies such as macarons and chocolate éclairs. With classic French music playing in the background, one can sit back and relax with a newspaper in one hand and a cup of espresso in the other. Unfortunately, the petite treats are pricey, with macarons at $2 apiece.  </p>
<p> The store is located at the corner of Chicago Avenue and Davis Street.

<h4> Peeled </h4>
<h5> Price range: $$ </h5>
<h6> Hours: 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. daily.</h6>
<p class="byline"> by Maggie Harden </p>


<p>Peeled is a juice bar in downtown Evanston that serves smoothies, cold-pressed juice, and breakfast bowls made with fresh fruit. The restaurant’s “Prickly Pear” juice is a smooth blend of pears and pineapple, and the “I Love Life” açai bowl is crisp, refreshing, and beautifully arranged. While it can take up to ten minutes to get an order, all of the food and juices are made fresh in front of customers. Coupled with the 15 minutes it takes to walk there, Peeled is a difficult place to go for a quick snack, but the smoothies and juices are easy to bring to lectures. Peeled can be a little pricey, but its fresh fruit and stunning arrangements make it a tasty and healthy alternative to Hinman. </p>
<p> The store is located halfway down the block of Church Street between Maple and Benson avenues.
